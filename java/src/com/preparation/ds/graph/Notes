Types of graph:
1. Regular Graph : each vertices has the same degree.
2. Complete graph : each vertex is connected with all other vertices directly. (degree v-1 each)
3. Connected graph : all nodes are reachable from all other nodes either directly/indirectly.
4. Directed graph  with direction
5. Undirected graph  bi direction
6. Acyclic graph  no cycles like DAG  directed Acyclic graph --> All trees are DAG, but all DAGs are not trees
7. Strongly connected Components  can be thought of as self contained cycles within a
    DIRECTED graph where every vertex in a given cycle can reach every other vertex in
    the same cycle.

Famous Algorithms:
1. BFS : unweighted (Shortest path, works that if encountered the target node , the first encounter would be the shortest)
2. DFS
3. Topological sort : Ordering of nodes, Shortest path for DAG +ve and -ve weights.
4. Dijkstra : Greedy, shortest path +ve weights. (Source to Target) : ( V + ElogV)
5. BellmanFoerd: DP, shortest path +ve,-ve weights. Can be used for -ve cycle detection. (S to T) (EV)
6. Floyd Warshall??
7. MST(Connected graph) : Prims : Greedy
         Kruskal : Start from node and consider its children



Algorithms:
1. MST:
    1. Kruskal's Algorithm
    2. Prim's Algorithm

2. SHORTEST PATH PROBLEM FROM Source to Target Vertex
    1. BFS : unweighted graph(first node encountered will be the shortest path)
    2. Dijkstra : weighted and no –ve edge. (BFS + priorityQueue over queue)
    3. Bellman Ford: weighted and considers –ve edge.
    4. Topological sort can be used for +ve and -ve edge to find shortest distance,
        provided graph is DAG.

3. LONGEST PATH FROM SOURCE TO DESTINATION : NP-Hard but if DAG, can be solved in O(V+E):
    Trick : multiply all edge values by -1 and find the shortest path and then multiply
            the edge values by -1 again.

4. ALL PATH SHORTEST DISTANCE:
    1. Floyd warshall

5. Connectivity: Does path exist between A and B?
    1. BFS
    2. DFS

6. Negative cycles : Does negative cycle exist --> might not want to consider such cycle in path
    1. Bellman Ford
    2. Floyd Warshall

7. Strongly connected components:
    1. Kosaraju
    2. Tarjan’s : also used for finding if the graphs contain cycle.

8. TSP : Travelling salesman problem  visiting all other vertices exactly once and come back to the source vertex. It is an NP-hard problem

9. Network Flow:
    1. Ford-fulkerson
    2. Edmonds karp and Dinic algorithm

10. Bridges in a graph

11. Topological sort: Find relation/dependecy in graph which needs to be built first than the target
    1. Example maven dependency tree
    2. Gradle build tree
    3. Recipe making instructions.
    4. Alien dictionary etc.
    Time Complexity : O(V+E)
    Topological orderings are not unique

    Topological can only be applied to DAG , if cycle is there it cant be done, hence cyclic
    dependencies are always issue.

For Path Finding: (we can use BFS,DFS, or Dijkstra)

Dijkstra = BFS + priorityQueue over normal Queue(becomes DFS with priority Queue since
                        since we are randomly visiting element than level order)
           One constraint for Dijkstra algo is that the graph must only contain +ve edge
           weights. This constraint is imposed to ensure that once a node has been visited
           /relaxed its optimcal distance cannot be improved.

           This property is especially important because it enables Dijkstra's algorithm
           to act in a greedy manner by always selecting the next most promising node.

1. if path has weights, then Dijkstra is preferred (though can be solved using BFS also)
2. If path has -ve weights also,
    Topological sort(if DAG) or
    simple backtracking + dp is preferred called as bellman ford
    The Bellman-Ford is pretty much the same as the DP approach except that it is more space-optimized.
    The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices
    in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs
    in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.
3. If weight are constant for each path use any from BFS,DFS.


BELLMAN FORD ALGORITHM: (works for negative cycles)
        Negative cycle is an issue, since if we revisit the graph again, -ve cycle will ensure that the shortest path value keep
        changing.

        Algorithm is run twice on all nodes.
        Second time is done to check if the shortest distance array computed from first run is being affected by second run.
        If, it is being affected which means there is a -ve cycle and hence it can be used to detect such cycle. Since all nodes
        for which it is changing are the nodes in the -ve cycle, mark them as infinty for reference.

        If not, then no -ve cycles in the graph.

        Algorithm : For each node , compute the distance of other node and update the distance array if it is less than the
                    existing distance. While starting with other node in iteration, take the minNode of that from distance as
                    existing weight(min to reach here).
            //1 Run:
            for(int i=1;i<=V;i++){
                for(Edge e : graph.get(i)){
                    int existingWeight = distance[i]; //min existing weight to reach at the ith vertex
                    distance[e.to] = Math.min(distance[e.to] , existingWeight + e.weight);
                }
            }

            //2Run:
            for(int i=1;i<=V;i++){
                for(Edge e : graph.get(i)){
                    int existingWeight = distance[i];
                    if(existingWeight + e.weight  < distance[e.to] ){
                        //this is part of negative cycle
                        distance[edge.to] = Integer.MAX_VALUE
                    }
                }
            }



Probs:
1. Find min/max , always an issue.
2. count is fine.
