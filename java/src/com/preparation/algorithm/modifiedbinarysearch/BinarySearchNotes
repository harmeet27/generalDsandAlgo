BS:
Property:
A. if the element is not found in binarySearch then after the end of while loop. start and end will be pointing to the
    neighbours of that element, if it was there.

    meaning start --> floor
    end --> ceil

    this is one of the way to find ceil and floor.

1. FindCeil/floor
2. First and last occurence, count of an element.
3. element in matrix
4. rotated element, search in rotated array.
5. peak element.
6. Bitonic array --> first increasing then decreasing and arr[i]!=arr[i+1] for all i
    Bitonic Array will only have one peak element always.
7. Find A Missing number in array of all other duplicates: o(logn)
    Hint: missing number would always be on the side where there are odd number of elements excluding.
    itself(middle)
8. Allocate pages of books(Hard)
