 In merge sort,
  *      worst case and average case has same complexities O(n log n).
  *      Space complexity : o(N) for merge operation.

  Efficiency:
  * Merge sort is more efficient and works faster than quick sort in case of larger array size or datasets.
  * whereas
  * Quick sort is more efficient and works faster than merge sort in case of smaller array size or datasets.
  *

  Sorting method :
  * The quick sort is internal sorting method where the data is sorted in main memory.
  * whereas
  * The merge sort is external sorting method in which the data that is to be sorted cannot be accommodated in the memory and needed auxiliary memory for sorting.

  Preferred for :
  * Quick sort is preferred for arrays.
  * whereas
  * Merge sort is preferred for linked lists.

 Arrays.sort() in java uses Quicksort for primitive types and Merge sort for objects.

 Advantage of quick sort: does not take any extra space, does in place sorting.
  *              Depth of recursion : Logarithmic with high probability
  *
  *
 Insertion sort for small arrays : size ~ 10
 Quick sort for slightly bigger array
 Merge sort for Larger array , in million or billions
