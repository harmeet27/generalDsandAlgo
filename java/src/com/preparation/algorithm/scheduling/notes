Meeting room:
1. Sort the array by start time.
2. Push the first meeting in a min heap of end times.
3. Iterate through meetings. If the earliest ending meeting has ended when the current meeting starts,
   i.e. heap.root.end <= current meeting's start, pop from heap.
4. Push this meeting in the heap
5. Required number of rooms = Heap size at the end
   Time/Space: O(n.lg n)/O(n), where n is number of meetings
