                        https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2020/12/31/nuts-and-bolts-problem-set-1/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20type%20of,are%20greater%20when%20ascending%20order.
                        Another way to ask this question is Lock and Key, a lock can be opened by its key with same number

10. Maths:
    1. Find palindrome of a number
    2. Find the smallest missing sum which cant be computed from the elements sum(used in any manner)
           1,2,3,6  --> 13
           1,2,5,6 --> 4
           2,5,6 --> 1
           Hint: idea is to keep computing the prefix sum and check whether prefixSum+1 < nextElement if(yes) then prefixSum+1 is the ans
    3. HCF/LCM/10.3 --> 3.3333..  --> 3.(3) --> use remainder than string searching, deciamls repeat if remainder comes same.
